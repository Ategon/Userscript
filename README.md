### 2. Install Autoplacer
- If Violentmonkey (or any other script manager) is installed:
- Click one of the two below:
    - [Auto-updating version](https://github.com/Ategon/Userscript/releases/download/latest/placecanada-userscript-autoupdater.user.js)
    - [Manual update version](https://github.com/Ategon/Userscript/releases/download/latest/placecanada-userscript.user.js)
    - If you don't want to have to worry about manually updating the userscript every time we make a change, pick the auto-updating version. When using the manual update version, please regularly check for updates.
- Click on confirm installation
